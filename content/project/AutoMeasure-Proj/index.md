Characteristics such as plant height and branch length are critical for crop production and mechanization of harvesting processes. To facilitate automatic measurement of these parameters in rapeseed plants, we developed a method that employs image processing to detect line segments within photographs of plants. Our approach incorporates the Line Segment Detector algorithm (Von Gioi et al., 2008) â€” a method recognized for its speed, precision, and leading-edge performance in line detection. To refine the output and remove extraneous and broken line segments, we implemented a series of filtering strategies that leverage the geometric properties of the detected lines. Experimental results reveal an impressively low error margin of 1.25% while utilizing modest computational resources, thereby aligning closely with the practical requirements of agricultural applications.
