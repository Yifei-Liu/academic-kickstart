It is essential to recommend the atomic service and a set of services with correlations for meeting users' QoS requirements in the era of service-oriented computing. To effectively organize and recommend web services, we make use of three-stage Bayesian network structure learning to construct a directed acyclic graph (network) and parameter learning to learn the conditional probability of all the nodes in the network. Compared with other service recommendation methods, the Bayesian network is more suitable for correlated services. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate and illustrate the functionality of the proposed method.
