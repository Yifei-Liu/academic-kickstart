Character parameters of crops like plant height and branch length are of great importance to production and mechanized harvest. We propose a methodology for measuring the character parameters of rapeseed plants automatically by detecting line segments in the plant images. The image line detection process utilizes a Line Segment Detector (PAMI 2010) which is a fast, accurate, and state-of-the-art algorithm. For eliminating the useless and short line segments, we have used a number of techniques based on the geometric features of extracted lines. The experiment shows that the error rate of the results is very low (around 1.25%) with inexpensive computing resources, which can better meet the actual demands of agriculture.
