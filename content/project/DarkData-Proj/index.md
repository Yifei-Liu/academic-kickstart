Dark data are some existing data that the developers or the users are not aware of their existence or value, or do not know how to extract value from them. To address the emerging dark data challenge, we propose a framework for assessing the values of image dark data by using a semantic hash ranking (SHR) algorithm. This framework can also score the image dark data, and therefore it helps find "important images" in the massive image dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate the performance and validity of our methodology.
