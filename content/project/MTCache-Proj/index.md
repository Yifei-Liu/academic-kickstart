Relying on modern storage devices, multi-tier caching has been broadly 
employed in cloud storage and data centers. The combination of different
devices, write policies, and cache replacement policies causes vast space
of multi-tier caching configurations. Particularly, users hope to gain 
better performance with lower purchase costs for the devices, but the 
enormous configurable space makes finding the optimal configuration 
impractical by evaluating all the possible configurations. Therefore, we
managed to apply point selection to detect valuable "key points" in the 
Miss ratio curves (MRCs). After experimenting with several existing point
selection methods, we proposed our novel point selection technique which
outperforms the existing methods and can identify the best multi-tier
caching configuration regarding cost vs. performance efficiently
and accurately.
